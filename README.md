# Description
Here, a comprehensive visualisation of the electric vehicle (EV) dataset has been created. This visualisation is an interactive Microsoft PowerBI dashboard containing some of the important parameters of EV.
The dataset used for this visualisation is [Electric Vehicle Dataset 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vanillatyy1/electric-vehicle-dataset?select=cars_data_cleaned.csv), downloaded from Kaggle.

## Objective
The purpose of this visualisation was to select some of the important EV parameters from the dataset and try to answer the questions below:

### Questions
1. Are there any brands with a long travel range and low price per km?
2. Which brands offer a good range as well as acceleration?
3. Which brands have the most efficient EVs?
4. Does the drive configuration play an important role in acceleration or efficiency?
5. Is the ability to tow related to any other parameter?
6. Does seating capacity affect any of the EV factors?
7. Is there any brand that has performed the best?

## Introduction
In this visualisation, the considered parameters are range, price per km, acceleration, efficiency, towing ability, drive configuration, and number of seats. 

## Insights
1. The average price per km of the top 10 brands in the best range is higher than the top 10 brands in price per km. Only two brands Fisker and Xpeng are seen in both the visuals.
2. The brands like Lucid, Lotus, Porsche, Voyah, Rolls Royce, and Tesla offer the best range as well as acceleration.
3. Dacia, Lancia, Fiat, Lucid, and Jeep top the chart having the most efficient EVs.
4. For acceleration, cars having All Wheel Drive (AWD) takes the least time for a 0-100 followed by Rear Wheel Drive (RWD) and Front Wheel Drive (FWD). Whereas, for efficiency, it is observed that EVs having FWD are the most efficient followed by RWD and AWD.
5. Having the ability to tow affects range, price per km, efficiency significantly, and acceleration slightly.
6. EVs with a seating capacity of 5 perform best in all the parameters, while the EVs with other seating variations affect one or the other parameters significantly.
7. According to the dataset, Lucid Motors tops the range chart, is among the top three brands in acceleration, and is the fourth most efficient EVs.

## Future Work
1. If the maintenance cost of these EVs is gathered, it will allow us to dive deeper and generate more insights. Therefore, ranking the best EVs will be much more accurate.
